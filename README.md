# Template Engine Employee Summary

## Description
![Screenshot]('/assets/app-screenshot.png')
This application allows users to input data surrounding their team to generate a summary page describing them. The user will be able to choose from three types of employees: manager, engineer, and intern. Upon choosing a role, the user will be asked universal questions such as name, id, and email, as well as specific questions to the type of employee such as engineer's github or intern's school. This can be done with as many employees as there are on the team. Once finished, the information is generated into a "test.html" page that formats and summarizes every employee entered.
